One of the required input for the two scripts is "PhenSer.txt". This file must be formatted in 4 columns tab-separated: PS identifier, MIM identifier, Entrez identifier, Symbol.
Here I put an example of the PS 174050 with its 3 associated diseases:

PS174050	174050	5589	PRKCSH
PS174050	617875	4041	LRP5
PS174050	617874	79053	ALG8
