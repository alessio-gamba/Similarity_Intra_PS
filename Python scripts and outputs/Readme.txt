One of the required input for the two scripts is "PhenSer.txt". This file is formatted with 4 columns tab-separated but the last two are not mandatory:

1. PS identifier
2. MIM identifier
3. Entrez identifier
4. Symbol

As example, I put here the PS 174050 with its 3 associated diseases:

PS174050	174050	5589	PRKCSH
PS174050	617875	4041	LRP5
PS174050	617874	79053	ALG8
